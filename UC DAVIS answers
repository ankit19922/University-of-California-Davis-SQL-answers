Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 records
ii. Business table = 10000 records
iii. Category table = 10000 records
iv. Checkin table = 10000 records
v. elite_years table = 10000 records
vi. friend table = 10000 records
vii. hours table = 10000 records
viii. photo table = 10000 records
ix. review table = 10000 records
x. tip table = 10000 records
xi. user table = 10000 records


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business      =  id             			10000
ii.  Hours       =  business_id    			1562
iii. Category    =  business_id    			2643
iv.  Attribute   =  business_id	 			1115
v.   Review      =	id,business_id,user_id	10000,8090,9581
vi.  Checkin     = 	business_id				493
vii. Photo       =	id,business_id			10000, 6493
viii.Tip         = 	business_id ,user_id	3979,537
ix.  User        = 	id						10000
x.   Friend      = 	user_id					11
xi.  Elite_years =	user_id 				2780

+------------------------+-----------+------+

1.  Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
	Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

	i.  Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
           	Yes ,they do have different distribution hours. As per our case for the category(restaurant) & city(phoenix)  2 to 3 star ratings operates for longer 
			hours than the one with 4-5 star ratings.

	ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
           	Yes they have different number of reviews.
         
	iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
		No, I unable to infer anything as two groups had different zipcodes	
	
	SQL code used for analysis:
		
		SELECT B.name , C.category,B.city,B.postal_code as zipcode,hours, 
		       CASE
			   WHEN stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
			   WHEN stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
		      END AS rating,
		      B.review_count as reviews
       		From business B
		Inner join hours H  on B.id = H.business_id
		Inner join category C on C.business_id = B.id
		Where city = 'Phoenix' and category = 'Restaurants' and rating in ('2-3 stars','4-5 stars')
		Group By name
		Order By stars desc
		
2. 	Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
	What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
	List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
	i. Difference 1:
         	The average review count was 9 points more for business that are open  than the business that are closed
         
	ii. Difference 2:
          	The number of distinct business_id for the one that are open is 5 times more than the business that are closed and hence the 
	    average review count is higher for the business that are open
         
         
	SQL code used for analysis:

		SELECT count(distinct id), 
			   count(distinct city),
			   avg(stars), 
               		   avg(review_count),
			   is_open
		From business
		Broup By is_open
		
3. 	For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset 
	and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
    I chose to analyse whether the businesses like restaurants having the arrtibutes like 'goodforkids' ,'alcohol' and 'free wifi'  
	anyway relate to the number of stars or the review counts that they get. I chose particulrly  the state 'Arizona'  as this state  has more 
	number of restaurants, has the review counts ranging from  the least to the highest and the ratings from 2 to 4.5 stars ffor my analysis.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    I used 3 tables like business, category and attribute for my analysis. 
	I chose the business name ,their catagory , the state in which they are run , the attributes they have, their ratings and their count of
	reviews. I took varibles like  A)name, state, stars , review_count from  the table business,B)category from the table category and C)name ,value from the attribute table.
	To connect all the 3 tables. I used the primary keys like id from business, business_id from category and 
	business_id from attribute table.
                 
	I want to know having a free wifi or restaurents good for kids or having full-bar or having any combination of 2 or all the attributes 
	contributes to good rating or having more reviews in particular.
